  <h1>Keel</h1>
  <p>A stabilizing framework for Backbone applications</p>
  <p>This example includes both compiled and uncompiled versions (before and after the grunt (v0.4) build is run:</p>
  <p>Note: If your web root is this directory, you should see content underneath the double line below. If this project folder is a subdirectory of your web root, changing line 14 of <code>/src/app/framework/AppConfig.js</code> to: </p>
  <p><code>root: "/keel/src/"</code></p>
  <p>should make the uncompiled source work (If this is multiple levels below the web root, all levels preceding /keel/ must also be included. If you renamed keel to something else, use that name). Running grunt (assuming it is installed) in the directory will build this change out to the compiled distribution, which should then work as well.</p>
  <p>The purpose, however, is not to look at how beautiful this site is, but read the source code, which can be downloaded in its entirety at <a href="https://github.com/archfirst/keel">https://github.com/archfirst/keel</a>.</p>
